Copyting and pasting large sections of code is a sure fire way to create numerous errors which are hard to track down. Beyond the benefit of keeping one's code in one place, using functions to separate out complex code makes the overall algorithm being developed more clear in that your thought process is more visible when complex operations are moved out into functions, especially when those functions are well named so their operation is easily understood. \n",
