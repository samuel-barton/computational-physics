\chapter{Digital Submission of Reports}
\label{app:submission} % Always give a unique label


Each project you do this semester will involve several pieces: Code, Images, and \LaTeX\ code. 
In order to make it easier for me to give timely feedback and to facilitate my record keeping, I am asking everyone
to follow a very specific format for both the naming and organization of submitted projects. I will now describe this structure in detail (you'll see that the format is really quite simple); however, keep in mind that
submitted projects that do not follow this structure will be returned and will need to be re-submitted
and will result in a 10\% penalty. 

I will be asking each of you to submit your reports electronically as a single compressed file (in Linux or Mac OS, just right click on a folder to bring up a dialog option to compress the folder.) 

\section{Folder Structure}\label{sec:Folders}
The folder structure is really quite simple, and Figure~\ref{fig:FolderScheme} shows the general layout; there is a single top level folder, which contains four sub-folders which delineate the major pieces of each assignment. Of these four sub-folders, only the LaTeX folder has one more sub-folder.

  \caption{You will submit a top level folder with four immediate sub-folders.
  The \LaTeX\ folder will also have one sub-folder containing all the figures generated by either Python code you wrote, or by a drawing program such as \emph{Inkscape}.}

After you understand the general scheme for structuring your assignment submission, you can see a specific example in Figure~\ref{fig:exampleSubmission}. Please email your assignment to me at \verb!pauln@maine.edu!, with subject line: \verb!PHY261 Assignment 01! (for example).
