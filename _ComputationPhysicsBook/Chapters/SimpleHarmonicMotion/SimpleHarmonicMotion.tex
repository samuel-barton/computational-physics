\chapter{Simple Harmonic Motion}
\label{ch-shm} % Always give a unique label
This chapter will involve simulating the physics of simple harmonic motion; in doing so, we will see the failure of the Euler method (and a resolution to this failure), how to simulate non-linear systems, and we will introduce phase space as a way to visualize dynamical systems. 

\section{The Simple Harmonic Oscillator}
\label{sec-simpleHarmonicOscillator}

Consider a mass resting on a horizontal frictionless surface and connected to a perfectly massless spring (see Figure~\ref{fig:physicsSpring}) that obeys Hooke's Law
